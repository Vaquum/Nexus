# Technical Debt

Known technical debt in shipped code. Each item includes origin, severity, and migration path.

## TD-001: WAL codec lacks version-dispatched deserialization

**Origin**: 1.2.1 (WAL entry types and serialization)
**Severity**: Low (only v1 exists)
**Module**: `nexus/infrastructure/wal_codec.py`

`deserialize_state` performs a strict equality check against `_CODEC_VERSION`. When v2 is introduced (e.g. adding a field to a domain dataclass), all data serialized with v1 becomes unreadable. WAL entries are ephemeral (truncated on snapshot), but snapshots persist — a codec bump without migration makes existing snapshots unrecoverable.

**When to fix**: Before any change to serialized domain dataclass fields.
**Migration**: Add version-dispatched deserialization (`_decode_v1()`, `_decode_v2()`, etc.) that routes on the embedded `_v` field so older snapshots remain readable across codec upgrades.

## TD-002: Checkpoint truncates strategy events needed for rolling loss windows

**Origin**: 1.3.4 (two-pass recovery with loss re-derivation)
**Severity**: Medium (losses undercounted after checkpoint)
**Module**: `nexus/infrastructure/state_store.py`

`checkpoint()` truncates the entire WAL including STRATEGY_EVENT entries. On recovery, `derive_rolling_losses()` only sees post-checkpoint events. Losses that occurred before the checkpoint but within the 24h/7d/30d windows are lost, causing rolling loss counters to undercount.

**When to fix**: Before periodic checkpoint scheduling (Phase 9).
**Migration**: Either (a) retain STRATEGY_EVENT entries for the longest window (30d) across checkpoints by truncating by age instead of full truncation, or (b) bake accurate rolling loss values into the snapshot at checkpoint time so they serve as baseline, with post-checkpoint events adjusting rather than overwriting.
